    <h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center">
		I have recently completed a Master of Science degree in computer science at Boston
        University.  I graduated from Bucknell University in 2016 with a Bachelor of
        Science degree in physics, as well as minors in math and computer science.  After college,
        I worked for two years at an intellectual property law firm before returning to school to
        pursue a higher degree in computer science.  I am nearing the end of the program, and I am
        excited to begin my professional career in software development.
