    <h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        I am currently a student at Boston University as a candidate for a Master of Science degree
        in computer science.  I graduated from Bucknell University in 2016 with a Bachelor of
        Science degree in physics, as well as minors in math and computer science.  After college,
        I worked for two years at an intellectual property law firm before returning to school to
        pursue a higher degree in computer science.  I am nearing the end of the program, and I am
        excited to begin my professional career in software development.

    <h2>PiC MAP - A Web Application for Managing Projects</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/PiC-MAP/PiC-MAP.github.io">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
        <a href="http://picmapmanager.herokuapp.com/">Link to Application</a><br>
        The application provides a platform for users to manage their projects, facilitating an Agile work
        environment.  Users can register an account and sign in to view their current projects, create new
        projects, and join existing projects.  Within each project, users can create project requirements, issues,
        and/or tasks, and assign users that are working on the project.  Requirements, issues, and tasks can be
        placed in one of three categories (To Do, Doing, and Done) to assist with organization, and users can
        include a deadline for each. There is also a chatroom within each project in which users of the project can
        communicate.

    <h2>Texas Hold 'Em AI</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/redwine168/TexasHoldEm">Link to Github Repo</a><br>
        In this application, the user can play against an artificial intelligence agent in a game of 1 vs. 1 Texas
        Hold 'em.  The application is run from the command line and provides an interface through which the user
        can play.  The application shows the current state of the board (e.g., cards dealt, current pot size, stack
        sizes for both the user and the AI).  The AI bases decisions on a range of hands that it thinks the user
        could have, how many of those hands the AI's hand beats, and the current bet size.

    <h2>Analysis of Different Algorithms for Generating Prime Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/redwine168/PrimeNumberAnalysis">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
        This console application examines various algorithms for determining the primality of an integer N.  The
        program lets the user generate an input number of prime numbers using one of a few algorithms.  In
        particular, I explored an algorithm that tries to quicken a brute force algorithm for determining the
        primality of an integer N (checking each integer from 1 to N as a factor of N).  The algorithm relies on
        the fact that you need only check prime numbers less than N, as checking composite numbers is redundant.

    <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe AI</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/redwine168/TicTacToe">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
        This console application provides an interface for playing against an AI in Tic-Tac-Toe.  The user may go
        first or second in a game, and may enter move selections by inputting the index of the location at which
        they wish to play.  The current state of the board (as well as a board showing move location indices) is
        displayed after each turn.  The AI is designed according to an algorithm that prevents it from ever losing.
