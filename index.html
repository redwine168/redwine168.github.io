		<h3 style="text-decoration:underline">ABOUT ME</h3>
		I am currently a student at Boston University as a candidate for a Master of Science degree in computer science.  I graduated from Bucknell University with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, as well as minors in math and computer science.  After college, I worked for two years at an intellectual property law firm before returning to school to pursue a higher degree in computer science.  I am nearing the end of the program, and I am excited to begin my professional career in software development.

	<div id="projectTitle">PiC MAP - A Web Application for Managing Projects<br></div>
	<div id="projectInfo">
		<a href="https://github.com/PiC-MAP/PiC-MAP.github.io" style="color:aqua">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
		<a href="http://picmapmanager.herokuapp.com/" style="color:aqua">Link to Application</a><br>
		The application provides a platform for users to manage their projects, facilitating an Agile work environment.  Users can register an account and sign in to view their current projects, create new projects, and join existing projects.  Within each project, users can create project requirements, issues, and/or tasks, and assign users that are working on the project.  Requirements, issues, and tasks can be placed in one of three categories (To Do, Doing, and Done) to assist with organization, and users can include a deadline for each. There is also a chatroom within each project in which users of the project can communicate.

	<div id="projectTitle">Analysis of Different Algorithms for Generating Prime Numbers<br></div>
	<div id="projectInfo">
		<a href="https://github.com/redwine168/PrimeNumberAnalysis" style="color:aqua">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
		This console application examines various algorithms for determining the primality of an integer N.  The program lets the user generate an input number of prime numbers using one of a few algorithms.  In particular, I explored an algorithm that tries to quicken a brute force algorithm for determining the primality of an integer N (checking each integer from 1 to N as a factor of N).  The algorithm relies on the fact that you need only check prime numbers less than N, as checking composite numbers is redundant.

	<div id="projectTitle">Tic-Tac-Toe AI<br></div>
	<div id="projectInfo">
		<a href="https://github.com/redwine168/TicTacToe" style="color:aqua">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
		This console application provides an interface for playing against an AI in Tic-Tac-Toe.  The user may go first or second in a game, and may enter move selections by inputting the index of the location at which they wish to play.  The current state of the board (as well as a board showing move location indices) is displayed after each turn.  The AI is designed according to an algorithm that prevents it from ever losing.

	<div id="projectTitle">School Registration System<br></div>
	<div id="projectInfo">
		<a href="https://github.com/redwine168/SchoolRegistrationSystem" style="color:aqua">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
		This console application provides an example system for registering students of a school to the school's courses. Written in C++, the application includes an interface through which the user can navigate. The user may add a student to the school, add a course assignment to a student, display the list of available courses offered by the school, display the list of all students in the school, and display the course enrollment of a specific student.

	<div id="projectTitle">Queue Application<br></div>
	<div id="projectInfo">
		<a href="https://github.com/redwine168/QueueSimulation" style="color:aqua">Link to GitHub Repo</a><br>
		This console application provides a simulation for customers in a queue.  The user can first input information for the number of minutes for the simulation to run, as well as information about the customers entering the queue.  The application includes a graphical display of the state of the queue as it evolves.
