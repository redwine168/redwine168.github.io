	<h2>Bucknell University</h2>
	<p>
		I attended Bucknell University from 2012 to 2016, graduating with a Bachelor of Science
        degree in physics as well as minors in both math and computer science.

    <h2>Wolf, Greenfield &amp; Sacks, P.C.</h2>
	<p>
		After graduating from Bucknell, I began working as a Technology Specialist at an
        intellectual property law firm in Boston called Wolf Greenfield.  I was a part of the
        Electrical and Computer Technologies group, working with attorneys at the firm in assisting
        both hardware and software companies to acquire patents.  This consisted of meeting with
        inventors to understand their technology, drafting patent applications, and helping
        represent the companies in front of the USPTO to prosecute the patent applications and get
        the patents issued.

	<h2>Boston University</h2>
	<p>
		I am currently a candidate for a Master of Science degree in computer science at Boston
        University.  I began the program in the Fall of 2018, and have a target completion date of
        December of 2019.  Throughout my time at BU, I've taken a variety of courses from
        mathematical classes like Computer Language Theory, Analysis of Algorithms, and
        Cryptography to engineering courses like Web Application Development, Software Engineering,
        and Artificial Intelligence.
